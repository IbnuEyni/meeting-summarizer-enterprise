Attendees: Sarah Johnson (Project Manager), Mike Chen (Lead Developer), Lisa Rodriguez (UX Designer), John Smith (Backend Developer), Alex Thompson (Data Scientist)

Meeting started at 10:00 AM

Sarah: Good morning everyone. Let's start with our project updates. We decided to move forward with the new learning management system after reviewing all proposals.

Mike: The technical architecture review is complete. We agreed that we will use Django for the backend and React for the frontend. This decision was made based on our team's expertise and scalability requirements.

Lisa: From the design perspective, we concluded that the user interface should follow Material Design principles. I will create the wireframes and mockups by Thursday.

John: Regarding the database, it was decided that we will implement PostgreSQL with Redis for caching. John is responsible for setting up the development environment by Wednesday.

Alex: For the analytics component, we determined that we need to integrate with our existing data pipeline. Alex will handle the machine learning model integration and needs to prepare the initial analysis by Friday.

Sarah: Great updates everyone. Let me summarize our action items:
- Lisa to complete UI wireframes by Thursday
- John must set up the development environment by Wednesday  
- Alex should finish the ML model integration by Friday
- Mike will review the security requirements and provide recommendations

We also decided to increase the project budget to $75,000 to accommodate the additional features requested by stakeholders.

The team agreed that we need to hire two additional junior developers to meet our deadline. Sarah will post the job listings this week.

It was concluded that our deployment strategy will use Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration.

Mike: One more thing - we determined that all code must pass automated testing before deployment. I will set up the CI/CD pipeline.

Sarah: Perfect. Our next meeting is scheduled for next Friday at 10 AM in the main conference room. We will review progress and discuss any blockers.

Alex: Should we also schedule a technical deep-dive session? We agreed that this would be helpful for the new team members.

Sarah: Good point. Let's meet again on Wednesday at 2 PM for the technical session.

The meeting concluded at 11:15 AM with everyone clear on their responsibilities and deadlines.
