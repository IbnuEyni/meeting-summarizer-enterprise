Project Phoenix: Strategic Q1 Alignment Meeting
Date: February 2, 2026
Attendees: David (CEO), Elena (CFO), Marcus (CTO), Priya (Marketing Lead)

David: Welcome everyone. We need to finalize our strategy for the Project Phoenix launch. 

Elena: Let's talk about the budget first. After reviewing the numbers, we decided to allocate an additional $500,000 for server infrastructure.

Marcus: That is helpful. Regarding the tech stack, it was agreed that we will use AWS SageMaker for our machine learning models to ensure scalability. 

David: Great. Priya, what about the campaign?

Priya: We concluded that the global launch will happen on April 15th. However, I have a concern. There is a potential risk that the creative assets might be delayed if the agency doesn't deliver by next week.

David: That's a serious blocker. Marcus, we need you to oversee the API integration.

Marcus: Understood. Marcus will lead the API development and must have the documentation ready by Friday. 

Elena: I also need the financial projections. Elena is responsible for completing the Q1 tax audit by Wednesday. 

David: Priya, you need to follow up with the agency. Priya to submit the final brand guidelines by March 10th. 

Marcus: We also determined that all user data must be encrypted using AES-256 standards starting immediately. 

Elena: Excellent. We agreed that this is a high-priority strategic decision for our compliance.

David: Let's wrap up. Our next meeting is scheduled for next Thursday at 2 PM to review the prototype.

Marcus: I'll make sure the dev environment is stable before then.

Meeting adjourned at 10:45 AM.
