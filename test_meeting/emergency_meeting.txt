URGENT: Database Performance Crisis Meeting
Date: February 2, 2026
Attendees: Robert (CTO), Julia (Database Admin), Sam (Lead Engineer)

Robert: We have a critical situation with the production database latency. We need immediate solutions.

Julia: We concluded that the main issue is a missing index on the transactions table. 

Sam: We decided to restart the read-replica to alleviate the current load. This is a critical decision to prevent a total system crash.

Robert: Julia, this is your top priority. Julia must patch the database indexing script immediately. 

Sam: I'm worried about data integrity. Sam is responsible for running a full data consistency check by 4 PM today.

Julia: We also determined that we need to increase our RDS instance size. This is urgent and will impact our monthly budget by $2,000.

Robert: Approved. Robert will lead the communication with stakeholders and must send an incident report by end of day.

Julia: Risk identified: if the index rebuild takes more than 2 hours, we might see a 10% timeout rate on the checkout page.

Sam: We agreed that we will disable non-essential background jobs until the crisis is resolved.

Robert: Let's stay in the war room. Our next meeting is scheduled for today at 6 PM to review the system stability.

Meeting concluded.
